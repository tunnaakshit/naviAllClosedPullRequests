Design an iOS App to display All Closed Pull Requests from Github public
repository of your own code.
UI should include : Title, Created date, closed date, userName, user

Refer: API:
https://developer.github.com/v3/

Things to keep in mind:
1.No need to persist data on app relaunch
2.Write clean, concise and 100% original code
3.You can use a networking library like Alamofire, AFNetworking, etc.
4.Besides the above, please do not use any other third-party library (you can use
some lib for image)
Judgement Criteria:
1.Quality and maintainability of code
2.Design of the user-interface and user-interaction
